/**
 * Entity representing a board.
 *
 * <p>Board is like a forum, containing zero or more threads revolving around defined topic. The
 * maximum allowed amount of active threads is defined in {@link BoardSettings#threadLimit}. Once
 * this limit is surpassed, the stalest (the one with the least recent {@link Thread#lastBumpAt}
 * timestamp) is pruned in order to make place for the most recent one.
 *
 * <p>Authorized users can create, remove and edit boards. There are several optional features, that
 * can be enabled on given board, via its {@link #settings}.
 *
 * <p>When the board is deleted, all its active threads (which also means all the posts and
 * attachments) are deleted along with it.
